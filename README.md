# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.

## Features
